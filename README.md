Topic: Drag and drop elements to create a website

Building a website is quite fun but at times it might get
frustrating and take up a lot of time. Instead, an application
which allows us to build a website just by dragging and
dropping elements would be much more efficient and user
friendly than coding each and every part of the website
(Similar to Wix). Also people with no prior knowledge of web
development could also build a website.
Develop a solution through which a person can create a
website just by dragging and dropping elements.
